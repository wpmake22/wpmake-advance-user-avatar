**Advance User Avatar – The Best Plugin for Uploading Custom Profile Pictures in WordPress**

By default, WordPress uses Gravatar for user avatars, which means users need to create a Gravatar account to show a profile picture on your site. This can be a big barrier for many users who don’t have a Gravatar account or don’t want to create one. As a result, they may end up with a generic, default avatar, which can make their profile less engaging. Without the ability to upload their own profile picture, users miss the opportunity to express their individuality and connect more with your site.

The **Advance User Avatar** plugin solves this problem by letting users upload their own profile picture (avatar) directly from their device. With this plugin, site owners can easily add an avatar upload field using a simple shortcode or Gutenberg block, giving users full control over their profile picture. This allows your users to display any image they want as their custom avatar, whether it's a personal photo, logo, or anything else. It’s the perfect way to enhance personalization and increase user engagement on your site.

The plugin also includes useful features like file type and size validation, so users won’t upload unsupported or oversized images. Plus, users can crop their profile picture to make sure it fits perfectly as their avatar. This gives them more flexibility and control over their profile picture’s appearance. By making it easy for users to upload their own avatar and customize it, the **Advance User Avatar** plugin creates a more personalized and engaging experience for everyone on your site.

### Features

* **Shortcode Support:**
  * `[wpmake_advance_user_avatar]`: Display the uploaded avatar anywhere on your site.
  * `[wpmake_advance_user_avatar_upload]`: Show the avatar upload form where users can upload or remove their profile picture.

* **Gutenberg Block Support:** Seamlessly add the avatar upload feature using the block editor.

* **File Type Validation:**  Admins can control which file types (JPG, JPEG, PNG) are allowed for profile pictures.

* **Max File Size Limit:** Set a maximum file size for uploaded avatars to ensure your site runs smoothly.

* **Image Cropping Interface:** Users can crop their profile picture to fit perfectly as an avatar.

* **[Premium] Webcam Capture:** Let users capture a profile picture directly from their webcam with optional cropping.

### How to Use the Plugin

1. Go to **Users -> User Avatar** in your WordPress dashboard.

2. You’ll see these settings:

   * **Max Avatar Size Allowed**: Set a size limit for uploaded images (e.g., 20KB). Users won’t be able to upload files that exceed this size.

   * **Allowed File Types**: Choose which file types are allowed for profile pictures (e.g., JPG, JPEG). The free version supports JPG/JPEG, while the PRO version adds PNG and GIF.

   * **Cropping Interface**: Enable this option so users can crop their profile picture before setting it as their avatar.
