**Advance User Avatar – The Best Plugin for Uploading Custom Profile Pictures in WordPress**

By default, WordPress uses Gravatar for user avatars, which means users need to create a Gravatar account to show a profile picture on your site. This can be a big barrier for many users who don’t have a Gravatar account or don’t want to create one. As a result, they may end up with a generic, default avatar, which can make their profile less engaging. Without the ability to upload their own profile picture, users miss the opportunity to express their individuality and connect more with your site.

The **Advance User Avatar** plugin solves this problem by letting users upload their own profile picture (avatar) directly from their device. With this plugin, site owners can easily add an avatar upload field using a simple shortcode or Gutenberg block, giving users full control over their profile picture. This allows your users to display any image they want as their custom avatar, whether it's a personal photo, logo, or anything else. It’s the perfect way to enhance personalization and increase user engagement on your site.

The plugin also includes useful features like file type and size validation, so users won’t upload unsupported or oversized images. Plus, users can crop their profile picture to make sure it fits perfectly as their avatar. This gives them more flexibility and control over their profile picture’s appearance. By making it easy for users to upload their own avatar and customize it, the **Advance User Avatar** plugin creates a more personalized and engaging experience for everyone on your site.

### Features

* **Shortcode Support:**
  * `[wpmake_advance_user_avatar]`: Display the uploaded avatar anywhere on your site.
  * `[wpmake_advance_user_avatar_upload]`: Show the avatar upload form where users can upload or remove their profile picture.

* **Gutenberg Block Support:** Seamlessly add the avatar upload feature using the block editor.

* **File Type Validation:**  Admins can choose which file types (like JPG, JPEG, PNG) are allowed for profile pictures. This stops users from uploading unsupported file types, ensuring only valid images are used for avatars.

* **Max File Size Limit:** Admins can set a maximum file size for uploaded avatars to keep the site running smoothly. This prevents slow loading times by stopping oversized images from being uploaded.

* **Image Cropping Interface:** Users can crop their profile picture to make sure it fits well as an avatar. This lets users adjust their image so it looks just right in the avatar space.

* **Webcam Capture:**  Users can take a profile picture directly from their webcam, with optional cropping. This allows users to capture a photo quickly, without needing to upload one from their device.

* **Different size images:** The plugin creates several sizes of the uploaded image to make sure the avatar displays correctly across the site. It automatically adjusts the image for different parts of the site to keep it looking consistent.

* **Uploaded Image Size:** Site owners can set specific width and height for the uploaded images. This ensures all avatars are the same size, keeping the site’s appearance uniform.

### How to Use the Plugin

1. Go to **Users -> User Avatar** in your WordPress dashboard.

2. You’ll see these settings:

   * **Store avatar in different thumbnail sizes**: Saves the avatar in various sizes so it looks perfect wherever it's displayed on your site.

   * **Max Avatar Size Allowed**:  Set a limit on how large uploaded images can be (e.g., 20KB). Users can’t upload files over this limit.

   * **Allowed File Types**: Choose which image file types (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF) are allowed for profile pictures.

   * **Capture Picture**: Allow users to capture picture using webcam.

   * **Cropping Interface**: Enable this option to let users crop their picture before setting it as their avatar.

   * **Uploaded Image Size**: Control the width and height of the uploaded images.
